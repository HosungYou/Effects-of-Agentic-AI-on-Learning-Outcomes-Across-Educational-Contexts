## 1. Introduction

<!-- 800-1,000 words -->
<!-- Key points:
- Educational AI systems deployed rapidly; fundamental design question about autonomy vs oversight
- Current approaches insufficient: Bastani et al. (2025) overtrust evidence
- Trust is the missing variable
- Purpose: (a) map trust conceptualizations via scoping review, (b) identify calibration gap, (c) propose two-level framework
- State RQs 1-4 explicitly
-->

## 2. Conceptual Foundation

<!-- 1,500-2,000 words -->

### 2.1 Trust in Automation: From Engineering to Education

<!-- Lee & See (2004): trust in automation, calibration, misuse/disuse/abuse

[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 2.2 Trust Calibration: The Core Concept

<!-- Definition: alignment between trust and AI capability
     Overtrust -> misuse (Bastani et al., 2025)
     Distrust -> disuse
     Calibrated trust -> appropriate use
     Why calibration > trust level -->

<!-- S-O-R framework: Stimulus -> Organism -> Response
     Trust vs. Reliance vs. Resistance
     Strengths and limitations
     Stops at individual use behavior -->

## 5. Critical Synthesis: The Two-Level Trust-Calibrated Oversight Framework

<!-- 1,500-2,000 words — WRITE FIRST -->

### 5.1 From Fragmented Trust to Integrated Framework

<!-- Synthesize the gap: Level 1 is studied, Level 2 is absent
     Wang et al. is best model but stops at individual use
     Trust calibration as system design target is missing -->

[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 5.2 Level 1 (Micro): Learner Trust Dynamics

<!-- Learner -> Trust/Distrust -> Reliance/Resistance -> AI Use Behavior
     Internal calibration: SDL, metacognition, critical thinking
     Map scoping review evidence -->

[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 5.3 Level 2 (Macro): System-Mediated Trust Calibration

<!-- Designer -> Checkpoint Design -> Trust Calibration -> Modifies Level 1
     External calibration mechanisms
     Teacher checkpoints, system checkpoints, transparency, friction design
     Adjacent field evidence -->

[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 5.4 Connecting the Levels

<!-- Trust calibration state determines optimal oversight
     Dynamic, adaptive model
     Bastani et al. as illustrative case -->

### 5.5 Mapping Evidence to Framework

<!-- Table 5: Framework mapping for each included study
     Most studies = Level 1 only
     Level 2 = the gap this paper fills -->

## 7. Limitations and Conclusion

<!-- 500-700 words -->

### 7.1 Limitations

### 7.2 Conclusion

<!-- Restate core argument
     Level 1 known, Level 2 missing
     "Is their trust calibrated?" not "Do they trust it?" -->
