## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Fewer studies than expected (<30) | Broaden inclusion criteria (e.g., extend to 2015-2025) |
| Low intercoder reliability | Extended calibration, more detailed coding manual, third coder |
| High heterogeneity | Pre-planned subgroup analyses; 3-level model |
| PROSPERO registration delay | Alternative: OSF pre-registration (faster) |
| Journal desk reject | Secondary targets identified (see research-proposal.md) |
