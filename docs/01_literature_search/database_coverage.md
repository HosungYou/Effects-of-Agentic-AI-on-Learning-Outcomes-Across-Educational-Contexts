| Web of Science ↔ ERIC | 40-50% | Education journals appear in both |
| Web of Science ↔ PsycINFO | 40-50% | Psychology journals covered by both |
| Web of Science ↔ IEEE | 30-40% | Technical papers in WoS |
| Web of Science ↔ ACM | 20-30% | Some CS journals in WoS |
| Scopus ↔ ERIC | 45-55% | Scopus has broader education coverage |
| Scopus ↔ PsycINFO | 45-55% | Psychology coverage in Scopus |
| Scopus ↔ IEEE | 35-45% | IEEE content partially in Scopus |
| Scopus ↔ ACM | 25-35% | ACM content partially in Scopus |
| ERIC ↔ PsycINFO | 30-40% | Educational psychology overlap |
| ERIC ↔ IEEE | 5-15% | Minimal technical content in ERIC |
| ERIC ↔ ACM | 5-10% | Very little overlap |
| PsycINFO ↔ IEEE | 5-10% | Minimal overlap |
| PsycINFO ↔ ACM | 5-10% | Minimal overlap |
| IEEE ↔ ACM | 20-30% | Some computing journals in both |

### 3.2 Unique Contribution of Each Database

| Database | Unique Contribution | % Unique Studies (Estimated) |
|----------|--------------------|:---:|
| Web of Science | High-impact multidisciplinary journals, robust citation data | 5-10% |
| Scopus | Broader journal coverage, more conference papers, more recent | 10-15% |
| ERIC | Education-specific grey literature, U.S. policy documents, ED-funded research | 15-20% |

## 4. Coverage Gaps and Mitigation

### 4.1 Known Coverage Gaps

| Gap Area | Databases Missing Coverage | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Non-indexed conference proceedings | All databases | Manual hand search of AIED, EDM, LAK conferences |
| Recent pre-prints (2024-2025) | All databases | Search arXiv (cs.CY), EdArXiv, SSRN |
| Regional journals (Asia, Europe) | WoS, ERIC | Scopus partially covers; backward citation tracking |
| Dissertations | All databases | ProQuest Dissertations & Theses |
| Technical reports | All databases | Government education agency websites |
| Workplace training grey literature | ERIC, WoS | ASTD/ATD research reports; corporate white papers (limited) |

### 4.2 Language Limitation

This review is restricted to **English-language publications**. This introduces a known limitation:

- An estimated 25-35% of AI education research is published in non-English languages (particularly Chinese, German, Spanish)
- Chinese AI-education research is rapidly growing and well-indexed in Scopus for English publications
- This limitation will be explicitly acknowledged in the manuscript

## 5. Rationale for Database Selection

### 5.1 Why These Six Databases

The selection of these six databases is justified by:

1. **Comprehensiveness**: Collectively covering all major disciplines relevant to Agentic AI in education
2. **Non-redundancy**: Each database provides unique contributions beyond the others
3. **Feasibility**: All databases are accessible via institutional subscription or open access
4. **Standard practice**: Consistent with prior meta-analyses in educational technology (e.g., Dai et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2021)

### 5.2 Databases Considered but Excluded

| Database | Reason for Exclusion |
|----------|----------------------|
| MEDLINE/PubMed | Minimal educational research; covered by PsycINFO for health education |
| Embase | Medical focus; minimal educational research |
| Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) | Subsumed within Web of Science Core Collection |
| CINAHL | Nursing/health education only; too specialized |
| SPORTDiscus | Physical education; out of scope |
| Education Source | ERIC covers same content more comprehensively |
