# Manuscript Writing Timeline

## Overview

This timeline links manuscript writing activities to the 7-month project timeline. Writing is conducted in parallel with late-stage analysis (Phase 5-6) to maximize efficiency. All sections are collaboratively authored per the role distribution defined in the research proposal.
