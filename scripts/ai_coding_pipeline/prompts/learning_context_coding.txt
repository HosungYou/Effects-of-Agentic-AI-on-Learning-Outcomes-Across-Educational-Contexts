CODING DEFINITIONS:

learning_context:
- formal_classroom: Traditional school/university course setting.
- blended: Mix of in-person and online.
- online_asynchronous: Fully online, students access at their own time.
- online_synchronous: Fully online with scheduled live sessions.
- self_directed: Learner controls pace, timing, and content selection entirely.
- workplace: Professional development, on-the-job training.
- informal: Non-institutional learning (museum, after-school, personal).

delivery_mode:
- fully_online: All instruction and AI interaction is online.
- blended: Combination of online and in-person.
- face_to_face_with_ai: In-person classroom where the AI is a physical or on-screen presence.
- hybrid: Students may choose online or in-person.

curriculum_integration:
- standalone_tool: AI is used outside regular curriculum as an add-on.
- integrated_into_course: AI is a required component of the official course.
- replaces_instruction: AI replaces human instructor for delivering content.
- supplements_instruction: AI supplements but does not replace human instruction.

learner_autonomy:
- low: Highly guided, students follow a fixed path with little choice.
- moderate: Some learner choice in pacing or content.
- high: Learner-driven, minimal prescribed path.

group_configuration:
- individual: Each student interacts with the AI alone.
- dyad: Two students interact with the AI together.
- small_group: 3-6 students per AI interaction.
- whole_class: Entire class interacts with AI simultaneously.
- mixed: Varies across sessions.
