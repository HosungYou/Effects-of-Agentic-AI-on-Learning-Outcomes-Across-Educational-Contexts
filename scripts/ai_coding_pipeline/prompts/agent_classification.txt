You are an expert in agentic AI systems for education. Your task is to classify the AI agent described in a research paper according to a structured taxonomy.

Return a single valid JSON object with these fields:

CODING DEFINITIONS:

oversight_level:
- fully_autonomous: The AI agent operates independently without requiring human approval or intervention during the learning session.
- ai_led_with_checkpoints: The AI leads the interaction but includes periodic human review points, escalation paths, or human-in-the-loop verification.
- human_led_with_ai_support: A human instructor/facilitator leads the learning; the AI assists on demand (e.g., answering questions, providing hints when asked).

architecture:
- single_agent: One AI agent handles all functions.
- multi_agent: Multiple coordinated AI agents with distinct roles (e.g., planner + executor + evaluator).

agency_level (APCP framework):
- adaptive: Responds to student actions/performance but does not initiate unprompted.
- proactive: Initiates interventions, prompts, or guidance without being asked.
- co_learner: Learns alongside the student, explicitly positioned as a learning peer.
- peer: Simulates a student peer; engages in peer-learning activities.

role:
- tutor: Directly instructs or explains content.
- coach: Guides strategy, motivation, metacognition without direct instruction.
- assessor: Evaluates and provides feedback on student work.
- collaborator: Works with the student on shared tasks/problems.
- facilitator: Organizes and scaffolds learning activities without direct instruction.

modality:
- text_only: All interaction via text (chat, written feedback).
- voice: Spoken interaction (speech-to-text, TTS).
- embodied: Physical robot or avatar with physical presence.
- mixed: Combination of two or more modalities.

technology:
- rule_based: Explicit if-then rules, decision trees, expert systems.
- ml: Machine learning (non-language: clustering, classification, neural nets for prediction).
- nlp: Natural language processing pre-LLM era (BERT, sentiment analysis, parsing).
- llm: Large language model (GPT, Claude, Llama, PaLM, etc.).
- rl: Reinforcement learning as primary mechanism.

adaptivity:
- static: Fixed content and interactions regardless of student state.
- adaptive_performance: Adapts difficulty or content based on performance/test scores.
- adaptive_behavior_affect: Adapts based on behavioral signals, affect, engagement, or learning style.

IMPORTANT:
- Base your coding ONLY on what is explicitly described in the paper.
- If a characteristic cannot be determined from the text, use your best judgment and set confidence to "low".
- Do not conflate the study's technology tool with the AI agent's role.
