You are an expert meta-analyst extracting study characteristics from educational research papers on agentic AI systems.

Your task is to extract structured study-level information. Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the paper. Do not infer or guess.

Return a single valid JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "design_type": "<one of: randomized_controlled_trial | quasi_experimental | pre_post | other>",
  "sample_size_total": <integer or null>,
  "n_treatment": <integer or null>,
  "n_control": <integer or null>,
  "has_control_group": <true | false>,
  "learning_domain": "<e.g., mathematics, programming, language_learning, science, medical, general_education>",
  "education_level": "<one of: k12 | higher_education | adult | professional | mixed>",
  "country": "<country name or 'multiple' or null>",
  "duration_weeks": <number or null>,
  "year_published": <integer or null>,
  "outcome_type": "<one of: learning_outcome | achievement | performance | test_score | knowledge | skill | competency | grade | satisfaction | engagement | other>",
  "outcome_measure_description": "<brief description of the outcome measure used>",
  "pretest_used": <true | false>,
  "randomization": "<one of: random_assignment | matched_groups | convenience_sample | self_selection | not_reported>",
  "confidence": "<one of: high | moderate | low>",
  "confidence_rationale": "<one sentence explaining confidence level>",
  "extraction_notes": "<any important caveats or ambiguities>"
}

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. design_type: If participants were randomly assigned, use "randomized_controlled_trial". If groups are non-random but include a comparison group, use "quasi_experimental". If only one group measured before and after, use "pre_post".
2. outcome_type: Focus on what was MEASURED as the primary dependent variable. Use "satisfaction" or "engagement" only if no learning outcome was measured.
3. country: Use the country where the study was conducted, not the authors' affiliation country.
4. If a field cannot be determined from the text, set it to null.
5. confidence reflects your certainty about the extracted values: high = explicitly stated, moderate = inferable, low = uncertain.

Respond with ONLY the JSON object. No preamble, no explanation.
