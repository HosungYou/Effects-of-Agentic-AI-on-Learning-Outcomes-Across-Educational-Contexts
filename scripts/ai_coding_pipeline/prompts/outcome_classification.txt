You are an expert in educational measurement and cognitive science. Your task is to classify the learning outcome measured in a research paper on agentic AI systems.

Return a single valid JSON object:

{
  "outcome_type": "<one of: declarative_knowledge | procedural_skill | conceptual_understanding | problem_solving | critical_thinking | metacognition | transfer | engagement | motivation | self_efficacy | satisfaction | other>",
  "blooms_level": "<one of: remember | understand | apply | analyze | evaluate | create>",
  "blooms_rationale": "<one sentence explaining Bloom's classification>",
  "measurement_instrument": "<description of how outcome was measured, e.g., 'multiple-choice post-test', 'coding assignment rubric', 'standardized test'>",
  "instrument_type": "<one of: researcher_developed_test | standardized_test | rubric | portfolio | observation | self_report | log_data | mixed>",
  "outcome_timing": "<one of: immediate_posttest | delayed_posttest | both | during_learning | not_specified>",
  "is_primary_outcome": <true | false>,
  "is_learning_outcome": <true | false>,
  "confidence": "<one of: high | moderate | low>",
  "notes": "<any caveats>"
}

CODING DEFINITIONS:

outcome_type:
- declarative_knowledge: Facts, concepts, definitions (what things are).
- procedural_skill: Step-by-step processes, algorithms, techniques (how to do things).
- conceptual_understanding: Deep comprehension of relationships, principles, structures.
- problem_solving: Application of knowledge to solve novel problems.
- critical_thinking: Evaluation, argumentation, synthesis across sources.
- metacognition: Awareness and regulation of one's own learning processes.
- transfer: Application of learning to new contexts not covered in instruction.
- engagement: Behavioral participation (time-on-task, completion rates).
- motivation: Intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, interest, persistence.
- self_efficacy: Belief in ability to succeed at tasks.
- satisfaction: Satisfaction with the learning experience.

blooms_level (Bloom's Revised Taxonomy):
- remember: Recall facts, list, identify, recognize.
- understand: Explain, summarize, classify, describe.
- apply: Execute, implement, use knowledge in familiar contexts.
- analyze: Differentiate, organize, attribute, compare.
- evaluate: Judge, critique, justify, appraise.
- create: Design, construct, generate, produce novel work.

instrument_type:
- researcher_developed_test: Test created by the researchers for the study.
- standardized_test: Validated, norm-referenced test (SAT, GRE, subject tests).
- rubric: Scoring guide applied to student work products.
- portfolio: Collection of student work over time.
- observation: Behavioral coding or structured observation.
- self_report: Survey, questionnaire, rating scale (Likert).
- log_data: System logs, click data, time-on-task.
- mixed: Multiple instrument types combined.

is_learning_outcome: Set to true only if the outcome directly measures knowledge, skill, or understanding acquired. Set to false for satisfaction, engagement, and attitude measures.
