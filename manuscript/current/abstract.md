# Effects of Agentic AI on Learning Outcomes Across Educational Contexts: A Meta-Analysis with Implications for Human-AI Learning Orchestration

## Abstract

Artificial intelligence agents capable of autonomous goal-directed action are proliferating across educational settings, yet the field lacks evidence-based design principles governing how these systems should be configured to maximize learning outcomes. This meta-analysis addresses that gap by systematically synthesizing empirical evidence on the effects of agentic AI on learning outcomes across K-12, higher education, and workplace training contexts.

Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we searched six databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) for studies published between 2018 and 2025. Primary analyses employ Hedges' g as the effect size metric within a random-effects framework (REML estimator), with robust variance estimation (RVE) to account for dependent effect sizes within studies. The study is theoretically grounded in Affordance Actualization Theory (AAT), Event System Theory (EST), Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the Dynamic Learner State model (Yang, 2025), and the Adaptive-Proactive-Co-Learner-Peer framework (Yan, 2025).

Five research questions guide the analysis: (RQ1) What is the overall effect of agentic AI on learning outcomes? (RQ2) Does the level of human oversight moderate these effects? (RQ3) Does agent architecture—single-agent versus multi-agent—moderate outcomes? (RQ4) Does learning context (K-12, higher education, workplace training) moderate effects? (RQ5) What empirically-grounded design principles can be derived to inform the HALO Framework for Human-AI Learning Orchestration?

This study makes two primary contributions. First, it provides the first meta-analytic examination of human oversight level as a moderator of agentic AI effectiveness in education—a dimension critical for responsible AI deployment. Second, it derives the HALO (Human-AI Learning Orchestration) Framework empirically from moderator analysis results, offering practitioners a principled, evidence-based guide for AI agent design across educational contexts.
